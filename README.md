tradable-start-useMarketDepth
=========================

This is a simple app which displays the use of the *com.tradable.api.services.marketdata.MarketDepth\** API. It shows what recent volume moved the market and what the price associated to the move is. You can use this template if you want to start a project where you will need to use the *com.tradable.api.services.marketdata.MarketDepth\** API or simply if you want to see how this API works.
See the REAMDE included in the tradable project to see how to open this project in Eclipse.
